This repository contains my C++ implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, meticulously following the "Take You Forward" platform's curriculum.

## About

Hello, I'm Atul Kumar Gupta, and this repository is a personal learning journey to solidify my understanding of DSA. I'm leveraging the excellent resources provided by the "Take You Forward" platform to systematically work through various problems and concepts.

## What's Inside

* **C++ Code:** Clean and well-commented C++ implementations of DSA problems.
* **Structured Organization:** Problems are organized based on the "Take You Forward" platform's modules.
* **Continuous Updates:** I'll be regularly updating this repository as I progress through the course.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/theatulgupta/DSA-with-C-.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/theatulgupta/DSA-with-C-.git)
    cd DSA-with-C-
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Desired Module:**

    * Browse the directory structure to find the specific DSA problem you're interested in.

3.  **Compile and Run:**

    * Use your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the code.
    * Execute the compiled program.

## Contributing
